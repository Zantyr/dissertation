            Show how groups are distributed in each age class

            Plot it with spider
    conclusions

European countries:

    select big samples (n>30)
        look for the largest value for each country
        look for numeric for each of those searches
        closer look at Poland(?)
    conclusions

Choose a proper data set for modelling
    which one
